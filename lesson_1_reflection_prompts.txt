How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps in recognizing what line is removed and what line is added.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could help me get back to any previous version of file I want or I need.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You commit after a logical change.
    Cons: You might fail to save file that could lead to unsaved changes in file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that it's easy to keep track of changes in multiple files dependent on each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    We can use git log to see history of changes in files.
    we can use git diff to see actual changes done in files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It gives confidence in a way that I have all versions of my file and I can
    jump back to any of the versions I want at any point.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my new projects
